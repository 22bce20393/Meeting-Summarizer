# Meeting-Summarizer

The Meeting Summarizer is a lightweight web app that takes in meeting audio recordings, converts them into text transcripts, and generates concise summaries with action items â€” all directly inside Google Colab.

This tool is perfect for summarizing long discussions, stand-ups, or client calls without deploying any external backend servers.
